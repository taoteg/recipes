*You burn some mesquite and when the coals get hot, you bunk up some meat and you throw it on a pot.*

*While some chile pods and garlic and comino and stuff, then you add a little salt till there’s just enough.*

*You can throw in some onions to make it smell good.*

*You can even add tomatoes, if you feel like you should.*

*But if you know beans about chili, you know that chili has no beans.*

*If you know beans about chili, you know it didn’t come from Mexico.*

*Chili was God’s gift to Texas (or maybe it came from down below).*
